# Agent

In software engineering, a software agent is a computer program that works on behalf of a user or another program.

In our case, a Service Agent works on behalf of the service it represents.

There is some overlap between microservices architecture and the Actor model in terms of concepts and philosophy.

A very good way to think about Agent is to look as what *Hollywood* agents do for *movie* actors.

The runtime would be the actor actually reading his lines during the shoot of the movie. But to get to that point, there are a lot of things that need to happen.

And usually the Agent is the interface (API) between studios, magazine, directors, etc..and the actor itself.

This is a very accurate comparison to describe what an Agent is for codefly: it is the prefered way of interaction (including creation, modification, enhancement, etc...) with the actor UP to the point of runtime.
